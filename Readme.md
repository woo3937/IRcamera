This is a single pixel infa-red camera. Normally, IR cameras are in the range
4,000-40,000 dollars. This camera costs ~100 dollars, and takes a not long
(unknown) time to capture an image. Examples will be shown on this page at a
later date.

This project is based off the instructions at [cheap-thermocam.tk][1]. These
instructions aren't very good, and many of the links are dead. Since I find that
frustrating, some better instructions are below.
